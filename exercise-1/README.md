# Exercise 1 - Accessing a Kubernetes cluster with IBM Cloud Container Service

Your IBM Cloud paid account and your Kubernetes cluster have been pre-provisioned for you. Here are the steps to access your cluster:

### Install IBM Cloud Container Service command line utilities

1. Install the IBM Cloud [command line interface](https://clis.ng.bluemix.net/ui/home.html).

2. Log in to the IBM Cloud CLI with IBM API key:   
   `bx login -u ibmcloudxx@us.ibm.com --apikey xxxx`      

3. Install the IBM Cloud Container Service plug-in with `bx plugin install container-service -r Bluemix`.

4. To verify that the plug-in is installed properly, run `bx plugin list`. The Container Service plug-in is displayed in the results as `container-service`.

5. Initialize the Container Service plug-in and point the endpoint to us-east.   
   `bx cs region-set us-east`

6. Install the Kubernetes CLI. Click the link corresponding to your operating system:

* Windows: https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.7.4/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe. Install the Kubernetes CLI in the same directory as the IBM Cloud CLI. This setup saves you some filepath changes when you run commands later.
    
* OS X: https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.7.4/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl
* Linux: https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.7.4/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl. If you are using OSX or Linux, complete the following steps.

    1. Move the executable file to the `/usr/local/bin` directory with `mv /<path_to_file>/kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl`.

    2. Make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is listed in your PATH system variable.
       ```
       echo $PATH
       /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
       ```
    3. Convert the binary file to an executable with `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kubectl`.


### Access your cluster

1. Set the context for your cluster in your CLI. Every time you log in to the IBM Bluemix Container Service CLI to work with the cluster, you must run these commands to set the path to the cluster's configuration file as a session variable. The Kubernetes CLI uses this variable to find a local configuration file and certificates that are necessary to connect with the cluster in IBM Cloud.

    a. List the available clusters. You should see the cluster `guestbook`.
    
    ```bash
    bx cs clusters
    ```
    
    b. Download the configuration file and certificates for your `guestbook` cluster using the `cluster-config` command.
    
    ```bash
    bx cs cluster-config guestbook
    ```
    
    c. Copy and paste the output command from the previous step to set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable and configure your CLI to run `kubectl` commands against your cluster.

2. Create a proxy to your Kubernetes API server.

    ```
    kubectl proxy
    ```
    
3. In a browser, go to http://localhost:8001/ui to access the API server dashboard.   

4. View details of your cluster.
    ```
    bx cs cluster-get guestbook
    ```

5. Verify the worker nodes in the cluster.   
    ```
    bx cs workers guestbook
    bx cs worker-get [worker name]
    ```
