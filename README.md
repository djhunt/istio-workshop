These workshop exercises are built with the help from a number of amazing Kubernetes and Istio experts from Google and Grand Cloud.

The Kubernetes and Istio exercises are derived from the work of Ray Tsang  [@saturnism](https://twitter.com/saturnism) and these repositories:

Zach was instrumental in helping write the Istio tutorials.

####  Kelsey Hightower [@kelseyhightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower)
The Istio Ingress Tutorial is largely based on the work of Kelsey and this repository:

[https://github.com/kelseyhightower/istio-ingress-tutorial](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/istio-ingress-tutorial)

Kelsey's tutorial uses more advance features of Kubernetes to taint some of the nodes so that the Ingress controller runs on dedicated nodes. The Ingress controller is then deployed as a daemonset.
